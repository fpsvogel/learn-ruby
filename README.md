# Learn Ruby: a resource list

Hi! As a second-career developer who didn't go through a bootcamp, I've found it helpful to keep a road map of learning resources—building my own curriculum, in a way. I hope this list helps you too!

If you notice any broken links here, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby-and-cs/issues/new).

## Preliminaries

- **If you want to keep it simple** and use just *one* resource that can take you from zero to hireable, I suggest the free [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). If you want more variety and more depth on certain topics, keep reading!
- **If you're wondering why I chose Ruby** and not full-stack JavaScript, [I explain why on my blog](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/why-learn-ruby). And [here's a second opinion](https://medium.com/learn-love-code/why-teach-ruby-bac8416c77ba) by the founder of a bootcamp that teaches Ruby.
- **Make sure your day job is conducive to part-time studying** if you're a working adult looking to switch careers. I used to be a teacher and spent hours grading in the evenings and on weekends, which would have made studying very difficult. So I switched to a remote customer support job to free up my schedule.
- **Find a system for keeping *organized* notes**, code snippets, and bookmarked links. I use [a simple text file](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/plain-text-knowledge-base).
- **You should spend more time *coding* than *reading about* coding**. I mention this because below I list lots of books and courses but not many hands-on projects. Why? Because starting a project and getting into a coding routine is easy (if you can't think of any project ideas, try these lists: [1](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x), [2](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning#ruby), [3](https://projectbook.code.brettchalupa.com)), whereas knowing what to read/study is not at all obvious at the beginning. Hence the focus on books and courses here.
- **Last but not least, take care of yourself!** Exercise and get plenty of sleep, and you'll better retain what you learn. If you develop wrist pain from heavy computer use, act swiftly: get an ergonomic keyboard ([the one I use](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/keyboardio-atreus) has a learning curve, but I love it *and* it was affordable), [do daily wrist stretches](https://youtube.com/watch?v=fdD7CgN5FGg), and try using a break app such as [Workrave](https://workrave.org/).

Without further ado, here is my learning road map. Resources marked with a dollar sign (💲) cost money. You may be able to find books for free (from your local library, interlibrary loan, or more dubious sources) but buy them if/when you can, to support the authors.

## Basics

### Front-end basics

- **Learn some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:**
  - [x] [The Odin Project - Foundations path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)
  - [ ] Or if that doesn't click with you, try resources under ["Front end"](#front-end) below.
- **Build a blog from scratch:**
  - [x] [Here's the first iteration of my blog](https://fpsvogel-2020.netlify.app), and [here's how I built it](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/zs). Building a blog is not only a good exercise in itself, but it might also give you extra motivation to write about what you learn.

### Ruby basics

- **Basics:**
  - [x] [The Odin Project - Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby)
  - [x] [GoRails - Ruby for Beginners](https://gorails.com/series/ruby-for-beginners) if you prefer watching videos.
  - [x] [Try Ruby](https://try.ruby-lang.org/) and [BigBinary Academy](https://academy.bigbinary.com/learn-ruby) if you prefer an interactive approach.
- **Guided practice:**
  - [x] [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby). Be sure to take notes each time you learn something new in an exercise, and at the end you could write up your reflections ([here are mine](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2020/exercism-ruby)).
- **OOP:**
  - [x] 💲[Sandi Metz - Practical Object-Oriented Design](https://www.poodr.com) and
  - [x] 💲[Sandi Metz & Katrina Owen - 99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles-sample-ruby)
- **Build stuff with Ruby.** Here are some ideas:
  - [x] A CLI (command-line interface) app. I made [one that gives statistics on a reading log](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/my-first-ruby-app-lessons-learned).
  - [ ] A game. See the [Games in Ruby](#games-in-ruby) section.
  - [x] A site using [Bridgetown](https://github.com/bridgetownrb/bridgetown). Maybe [rebuild your blog](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/build-a-blog-with-bridgetown)? Be sure to [join the Bridgetown Discord server](https://discord.gg/Cugms94QFM)—the maintainers are very welcoming and helpful to newbies.
- **Reference:**
  - [x] [Ruby API](https://rubyapi.org). Mentioning it up here because it's the best Ruby docs site but very little-known. Since its search uses a query param, you can add a search keyword to your browser to let you quickly search from the address bar, for example "rb partition" would take you to https://rubyapi.org/3.2/o/s?q=partition

### Rails basics

Only books and courses are listed below, but be sure to *build things* as you learn. I myself [started building a large-ish Rails app](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/first-rails-app-plain-reading) at first, but then I found it more helpful to build a series of small throwaway apps ([1](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/gpt3-ai-story-writer), [2](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/wikipedia-explorer-discover-articles-like-stumbleupon), [3](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2021/pass-the-story-collaborative-writing-game), [4](https://fpsvogel.com/posts/2022/doctor-lookup-health-provider-search-tool)).

### Ruby/Rails communities

Here are some places where you can learn with others or ask questions when you get stuck.

- **Mentorship:** I got mentorship about a year after starting with Rails, but you may benefit from it earlier.
  - [First Ruby Friend](https://firstrubyfriend.org) where aspiring and first-year developers are connected with a mentor.
  - [The Rails subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails) is another good place to find a mentor. It's not uncommon for someone to post asking if anyone is available to mentor, and these posts typically get quite a few replies from potential mentors.
- **Communities:**
  - [The Ruby Learning Center](https://www.rubylearning.dev/)
  - [Code with Jason Meetup](https://www.codewithjason.com/meetup)
  - [StimulusReflex community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/stimulus-reflex)
  - [Ruby on Rails Link community on Slack](https://www.rubyonrails.link/)
  - [GoRails community on Discord](https://discord.gg/gorails)
- **Subscribe to Ruby newsletters:** You can learn a lot by listening in on what the Ruby community is talking about.

## Rails codebases to study

I've chosen the codebases below based on a these criteria:

- Is active, with recent commits.
- Does not use a JS framework on the front end, though I made exceptions.
- Is well-known *or* it solves a problem that's interesting to me.

If you want to explore more widely, here are other places to find open-source Ruby projects:

- [OpenSourceRails](https://opensourcerails.org/)

- [Awesome Ruby and Rails Open Source Apps](https://github.com/asyraffff/Open-Source-Ruby-and-Rails-Apps)

## Games in Ruby

The minimalist route is to build a text-based game in Ruby, or to contribute to a project like [Magic: The Gathering: The Ruby Project](https://github.com/radar/mtg), where you can [implement Magic cards in Ruby](https://github.com/radar/mtg/issues).

If you want to make a graphical game, there are a few tools to choose from. The one with the most active community is 💲[DragonRuby Game Toolkit](https://dragonruby.itch.io/dragonruby-gtk). You may qualify for a free license (see "Free Unrestricted License" on the homepage), and the creators regularly give it away for free at game jams and other special occasions.
